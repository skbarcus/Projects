\chapter{Introduction: Limited Land Counts}
\label{intro}

Everyone who has ever shuffled up a 40 card limited deck has been confronted with the same question. How many lands should I run? And every time they draw from that deck, another question arises. Should I keep this hand? As with most things in Magic the Gathering, the answer to these questions is generally, ``It depends."

Throughout Magic's history it has generally come to be accepted that the default number of lands in a 40 card limited deck is 17. But where did the number 17 come from? Why is that the `optimal' number of lands. The answer of course, is that it is not always the optimal number of lands to run. Slower, more powerful limited formats, may incentivize playing more than 17 lands. Whereas, fast formats, where board early presence dominates, may incentivize playing fewer than 17 lands. Similarly, a player with a classical `control' deck may wish to run more than 17 lands to be certain to hit all of their land drops for their powerful, but generally more expensive, spells. A player with a lower curve `aggro' deck, may instead want to run fewer than 17 lands. 

Once you have decided how many lands your limited deck should run you draw your opening seven and see just a single land. Conventional Magic wisdom is that you generally mulligan one-landers, but to be the best limited player one can, one must be able to tell when conventional heuristics are wrong. Maybe you have two strong two drops in your agrro deck's one land opening hand and are on the play. What if you are on the draw? Maybe your control deck must hit its first four or five land drops on curve to be competitive. Can you keep a two land opener on the draw? 

To answer these questions you need to know your deck and how it is trying to win. You need to know how your game plan influences the number of lands you want to draw and when you want to draw them. No amount of tables and graphs can replace the hard-won experience earned from slinging spells against clever opponents. This document contains the statistics governing the answers to many of the above questions. This document cannot, however, answer these questions for you. Instead this document aims to give you the foundational statistical tools you need to make informed decisions regarding lands in limited.

\section{The MTGA Best of One Shuffler}
\label{sec:computers_overview}

The number of people playing MtG digitally has greatly increased with the release of Magic the Gathering Arena. With the advent of MTGA came a new emphasis on best-of-one (Bo1) games. For these MTGA Bo1 games, Wizard's introduced the Bo1 shuffler to reduce the number of non-interactive games. Unlike in traditional Bo3 games, MTGA Bo1 games draws two opening seven card hands from your deck when a game begins. The Bo1 shuffler then calculates which of these two hands to keep based on which of the hands has a land ratio closest to that of your deck overall. MTGA then presents you with the hand with the closer land ratio to that of your deck as your opening hand. (Note: You never see the other hand.)

For example, if we have a 40 card limited deck with 17 lands in it our deck is 42.5\% (17/40) lands. Now assume the Bo1 shuffler draws one hand with two lands and five nonlands and one hand with three lands and four nonlands. The first hand is 28.6\% (2/7) lands and the second hand is 42.9\% (3/7) lands. In this case the Bo1 shuffler will select the second hand with three lands in it because 42.9\% lands is closer to the deck's land ratio of 42.5\% than the two land hand's 28.6\%. 

The theory behind the Bo1 shuffler is that you will have more opening hands closer to your deck's land percentage. This greatly reduces the variance in opening hands, which leads to more keepable opening hands, and hopefully more fun interactive games of Magic. This has led to the belief among many players that it is better to default to playing 16 lands in limited when playing Bo1 games. 

The argument goes that running 17 lands in a 40 card deck leads to drawing more lands over the whole game than desired (flooding). The traditional reason to run 17 lands in limited is for color considerations and to make certain that one hits one's important land drops on curve (i.e. having three lands on turn three). But if the Bo1 shuffler causes us to draw more three land opening hands, even with only 16 lands in a deck, then the risk of not hitting land drops on curve is greatly reduced, and one can play fewer lands to prevent late game flood. This document will present statistics for Bo1 opening hands as well as traditional opening hands so that readers can make an informed decision when deciding how many lands to run.

\chapter{Results and Analysis}
\label{results}

The values given in the following tables and plots are analytic\footnote{Tables and plots were produced with Python, SciPi, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.}, however the opening hand alnd percentages were cross checked against a Monte Carlo simulation as a sanity check. The two methods were found to be in good agreement. When using these results remember, every decision you make must be made with the composition of your deck in mind. Only when you understand the game plan of your deck can statistics help you to make an informed decision.

\section{Opening Hand Land Statistics}
\label{opener}

The most fundamental statistic governing the number of lands to put in a deck is the average number of lands you can expect to draw in an opening hand. Figure \ref{fig:opening_hand_percentages} shows the percentage of seven card hands that will have a given number of lands in them for 40 card limited deck. The values are given for decks with between 14 and 20 lands, as well as for traditional draws and Bo1 draws.  

	\begin{figure}[!ht]

	\caption{
	{\bf{Average Opening Hand Land Percentages.}} This table gives the percentage chance of drawing between zero and seven lands in an opening hand of a 40 card limited deck. Odds are given for 14 to 20 lands in a deck, as well as for a traditional Magic opening hand draw and an MTGA Bo1 draw.}
	\label{fig:opening_hand_percentages}
	\end{figure}	
	
Here we see right away why 17 lands is considered the default number of lands for a 40 card limited deck to run when using the traditional opening hand draw. Putting 17 lands in your limited deck gives you the highest chance (32.30\%) of having three lands in your opening hand. Having three lands in your opener guarantees you hit the extremely important land drops on turns one to three. However, look at what happens when we use an MTGA Bo1 opening hand. Suddenly our odds of having three lands in our opener with 17 lands in the deck is 54.16\%. That's an enormous increase! What's going on here?

To understand why the opening hand land odds changed so much let's plot a histogram of the chances of drawing between zero and seven lands in your opening hand for a traditional draw and a MTGA Bo1 draw as in Figure \ref{fig:traditional_vs_bo1_17}. The effect of the MTGA Bo1 draw is that it `tightened up' the distribution centered around drawing three lands in your opener. Because the Bo1 shuffler draws two hands and keeps the one with the land ratio closest to that of your deck you will draw more three land hands. This decreases the likelihood of drawing a land ratio in your opener that is very different than the land ratio of your deck. You were already less likely to draw a six land opener than a three land opener with a traditional draw, but now if you draw a six land opener (85.8\% lands) as one of your Bo1 opening hands then the second hand will be chosen instead unless it has zero (0\% lands), six (85.8\% lands) or seven lands (100\% lands) in it. This is because these are the only land ratios further away from that of your deck (42.5\% lands). The overall effect is to greatly decrease the number of opening hands that have land ratios much different than your overall deck. In fact, drawing a seven land opener for a 40 card limited deck with 17 lands in MTGA Bo1 games only happens one in 918,984 times!

	\label{fig:traditional_vs_bo1_17}
	\end{figure}	
	
Let's take this a step further and see how the odds of drawing between zero and seven lands in an opening hand vary for 40 card limited decks with 14 to 20 lands in them. First we'll plot\footnote{Plots were made using Seaborn's kdeplot function and adjusting the bandwidth parameter until the distributions were clear.} the distributions for only traditional opening hand draws as in Figure \ref{fig:traditional_distributions}. Notice how the most frequent number of lands in an opening hand smoothly increases from 14 land decks up to 20 land decks. The bumps on the plot are due to the discrete nature of drawing cards. You can only draw an integer number of lands in an opening hand (i.e. you cannot draw 2.5 lands in a hand). As we saw in the table the distribution with the highest peak at three lands in an opening hand is a deck with 17 lands (red curve).

 	\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=1.\linewidth]{/home/skbarcus/Projects/MtG/MTGA_Opening_Hands/Pictures/Distribution_of_Lands_Normal_Opener_kdeplot_14-20.png}}
	\caption{
	{\bf{Opening Hand Land Percentages Using a Traditional Draw.}} Odds are given for a 40 card limited deck with between 14 and 20 Lands.}
	\label{fig:traditional_distributions}
	\end{figure}	

This all seems rather intuitive so far. If we start with only 14 lands in a deck and begin adding lands the average number of lands in our starting hand will increase in a relatively smooth fashion. But what do these distributions look like for the MTGA Bo1 opening hands which can are given in \ref{fig:bo1_distributions}?
